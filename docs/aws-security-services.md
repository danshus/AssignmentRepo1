## üõ°Ô∏è Security Integration Example

### Scenario: Security Incident Response

**1. GuardDuty Alert**: "Suspicious API calls detected"
```yaml
# GuardDuty provides:
- Finding: "Suspicious API calls from unusual location"
- Severity: HIGH
- Affected resources: EKS cluster
- Recommended action: Investigate immediately
```

**2. CloudTrail Investigation**: "What exactly happened?"
```yaml
# CloudTrail provides:
- User: unknown-user@compromised-account.com
- Actions: 
  - CreateLoadBalancer
  - ModifySecurityGroup
  - CreateEC2Instance
- Time: 2024-01-15 02:30:00 UTC
- Source IP: 185.220.101.45 (suspicious location)
```

**3. VPC Flow Logs Analysis**: "What network traffic occurred?"
```yaml
# VPC Flow Logs provide:
- Unusual outbound traffic to external IPs
- Large data transfers to unknown destinations
- Connections to suspicious ports
- Traffic patterns indicating data exfiltration
```

## üîß Implementation in Sentinel Architecture

### CloudTrail Implementation
```yaml
# What we track:
- EKS cluster creation/modification events
- Security group and network policy changes
- VPC peering connection events
- IAM role and policy modifications
- Terraform infrastructure deployments
- User access to AWS resources

# Example events:
- "User john.doe created EKS cluster 'eks-gateway'"
- "Security group 'sg-backend' modified at 14:30 UTC"
- "VPC peering connection established between vpc-gateway and vpc-backend"
```

### GuardDuty Implementation
```yaml
# What it detects:
- Unusual API calls from new locations
- Suspicious EKS cluster activities
- Anomalous network traffic patterns
- Potential credential compromise
- Data exfiltration attempts
- Cryptocurrency mining activities

# Example findings:
- "Suspicious API calls detected from unusual location"
- "Anomalous data transfer detected from EKS cluster"
- "Potential credential compromise in IAM user"
```

### VPC Flow Logs Implementation
```yaml
# What we monitor:
- Traffic between gateway and backend VPCs
- Cross-VPC communication patterns
- Load balancer traffic flows
- Pod-to-pod communication
- External internet traffic

# Example logs:
- "Source: 10.0.1.100, Destination: 10.1.1.50, Protocol: TCP, Port: 80, Action: ACCEPT"
- "Source: 10.1.1.50, Destination: 0.0.0.0/0, Protocol: TCP, Port: 443, Action: ACCEPT"
```

      enable = true
    }
    kubernetes {
      audit_logs {
        enable = true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### VPC Flow Logs Configuration
```hcl
resource "aws_flow_log" "vpc_flow_log" {
  iam_role_arn    = aws_iam_role.vpc_flow_log.arn
  log_destination = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.vpc_flow_log.arn
  traffic_type    = "ALL"
  vpc_id          = aws_vpc.main.id

## üìã Key Takeaway

- **CloudTrail** = "What happened?" (Audit trail)
- **GuardDuty** = "Is this a threat?" (Intelligent detection)
- **VPC Flow Logs** = "What network traffic occurred?" (Network analysis)

**Together**, they provide comprehensive security monitoring:
- **Reactive** (CloudTrail) + **Proactive** (GuardDuty) + **Network** (VPC Flow Logs) = **Complete Security Visibility**
